# Tech with Tim movie app for React practice

Been a while since I made a react project from scratch so thought I'd do a code-along tutorial. I've chosen Tim's as I'm keen to put this over a Flask backend later on to also refresh my knowledge of that. A long time with Model View Controller architecture, I'm keen to have a look at the Model View Template and compare the two.
